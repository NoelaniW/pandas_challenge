In conclusion,
Distrist schools tend to be of larger size and possess greater budgets per school and per student than Charter schools, however it appears that students attending charter schools have accomplished a significantly
higher overall passing rate for both math and reading.
We could assume that smaller schools would have a more of a positve effect on a students' performance for many reasons as well as possess a more efficient system for utilizing funds. Though we do not have the data that would provide those insights such as: demographic information, class size, teacher availability, fund allocation, etc.
